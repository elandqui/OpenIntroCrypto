Read below for some unique ways that you can help [**support**](#support) this project.

<b>History and Philosophy of the Book:</b>
  The initial development of this textbook was supported by a Small Grant from the Educational Advancement Foundation, via the Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning in the summer of 2015. This book
  was then used in the Spring 2016 semester for an introductory course in cryptography for
  upperclassmen majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at Kutztown University in Kutztown, PA.
  The text was expanded and edited during the spring and summer of 2016.

  I will be teaching a First Year Seminar (FYS) course entitled "Secrecy and Information Security" in the Fall 2018 semester and I intend to edit this text to make it suitable for freshmen while maintaining its active learning character. One learns best by doing, so this course will be a hands-on course from start to finish. In addition to rigorous academic content, FYS courses will include modules on personal development such as time and financial management, career planning, and development of soft skills. Also, because of the high and rising cost of textbooks in higher education, my goal is for all course materials to be free and open. To this end, I am seeking additional funding to complete this textbook so that it is a standalone text suitable for a general education course in cryptography, as well as for advanced undergraduates. One major component that I plan to include is a chapter on cryptocurrencies and blockchain concepts. This is an opportunity for organizations operating within these fields to gain brand recognition among students nation-wide that will use this text.

<b>Benefits for Supporters:</b>
  Those wishing to support the development of this textbook will be acknowledged in the text. More importantly, your products and services will be highlighted in the text itself through examples, homework problems, projects, and other means. There will also be space available for advertising. The money that students save by taking a course utilizing OERs are more likely to invest their money with you simply by seeing your products and services advertised in their text.

<b>Work to be done on the text:</b>
  * Make the text standalone. In other words, completely remove references to readings and exercises in the Washington text. (That is a great book, but this is to be a standalone text.)
  * Expand introductory chapters for general education.
  * Create a chapter on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
  * Create both PDF and HTML versions of the book, like Rob Beezer's Linear Algebra text.
  * Incorporate Sage cells and Sage code throughout the text. (Sage is a free computer algebra system built on top of Python and will allow for computations of cryptographic size.)
  * Development of homework problems for the MAA's Open Problem Library for WeBWorK (http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/National_Problem_Library).
