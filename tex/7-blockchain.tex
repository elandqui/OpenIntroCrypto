\chapter{Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies}
\label{ch:chain}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Digital cash and cryptocurrencies\\
    Before Bitcoin, digital cash systems relied on a central certifying authority (a bank) to regulate any transaction and generally did not discuss the creation of money. Bitcoin changed the digital cash paradigm by uniting the creation of digital money and the decentralization of transaction authentication. Since Bitcoin, hundreds of other so-called {\em cryptocurrencies} have been created based on Bitcoin concepts. For background on digital cash, read \S 11.1 in \cite{tw}.
    \item{The blockchain concept}\\
    Bitcoin introduced the concept of the blockchain, but numerous other applications of this digital technology have been considered. Describe the mathematics and algorithms of a blockchain and its potential uses besides cryptocurrencies.
    \item{KutzCoins}\\
    Make progress towards a system in which students are compensated with a digital currency (which Dr.\ L.\ calls {\em KutzCoins}) that could be redeemable for Bear Bucks by donating computing time on their computers for student and faculty research.
